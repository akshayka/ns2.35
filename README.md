Q-Learning for TCP Congestion Control
======

This fork of NS-2 is an experiment in applying q-learning to TCP congestion control.

To see how to use the harness: python runremy.py --h

NB: Since all my experiments were simulations, I do not have any raw data to submit.

For installation instructions, see http://web.mit.edu/remy/#reproduce. The install script packaged there should be compatible with my version of NS2 as well.
