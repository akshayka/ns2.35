Q-Learning for TCP Congestion Control
======

This fork of NS-2 is an experiment in applying q-learning to TCP congestion control.

Relevant files: 
tcp/q-learn.cc
tcp/q-learn.h
tcp/tcp-naive-q.cc
tcp/tcp-naive-q.h
tcl/ex/congctrl/runremy.py (the test harness)

For installation instructions, see http://web.mit.edu/remy/#reproduce. The install script packaged there should be compatible with my version of NS2 as well.
